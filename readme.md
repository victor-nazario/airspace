# Airspace

###What?
Airspace is an [xbar](https://github.com/matryer/xbar) plugin that shows you a detailed list of airplanes in the airspace above
you. This list is details the airplane call-sign, its country of origin and even its groundspeed and altitude. 
Furthermore, this elements are clickeable, allowing the user to learn more about the aircraft. 

###How?
This plugin is a simple Python script that obtains the user's advertised public ip address and constructs a geographical
area around the estimated location, then it obtains the planes located in the airspace bounded by that area.

###Why? 
As an aviation geek, if often hear planes above my location, I usually rapidly open something like FlightRadar
to learn more about its precedence, altitude, etc. With this plugin, fellow av-geeks can rapidly find more info about
the airspace above them.
